# About me

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Mariana Vivas and I'm a data scientist and physist. 

I entered the world of data science doing the [final project of my degree](https://github.com/marianaiv/tesis_grado_UCV) using [machine learning to search for new physics](https://github.com/marianaiv/benchtools) in simulated data of the LHC. My interest lean toward machine learning, data engineering and open science. 

In the last months I finished Henry's bootcamp, where I deepened my knowledge in Python and machine learning, and learned new tools as SQL, Docker, PowerBI, among others. These can be seen in the projects made during the bootcamp:
- The team project on [seismic alerts](https://github.com/MLGIdata/seismic-alerts)
- The individual projects:
  - [ETL with python and MySQL](https://github.com/marianaiv/ETL_PI01)
  - [Machine learning model to classify real state data](https://github.com/marianaiv/datathon_PI02)
  - [Data analysis of plane crashes since 1908](https://github.com/marianaiv/analytics_PI03)

I'm currently working to grow as a data scientists.
